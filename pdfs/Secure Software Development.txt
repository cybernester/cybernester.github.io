A comprehensive project focused on the exploration and recreation of a significant vulnerability in PostgreSQL, specifically CVE-2019-10164. This project aims to analyse the vulnerability, classified as CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), in order to understand the root cause and potential consequences. By replicating the exploit, we will delve into the technical details and shortcomings that led to this vulnerability. As part of our findings, we will provide recommendations for implementing bounds checking mechanisms, inspired by the official patch released by PostgreSQL. The primary goal of this project is to enhance the security of software development processes by leveraging the lessons learned from this case study, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and secure software systems.
